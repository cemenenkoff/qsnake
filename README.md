# Snake and Deep Q Reinforcement Learning

This project contains the following files:
1. **environment.py**

   This is the environment that represents the snake game. If you run `python environment.py`, you'll be able to play snake manually with the arrow keys.
____
2. **agent.py**

   This script trains an agent to play snake via a deep Q-learning network. Running `python agent.py` causes the agent to autonomously train over a specified number of episodes.
____
3. **plotting.py**

   This is a supporting script that graphs some statistics about how the network was trained and the performance of the agent.
____
4. **requirements.txt**

   After cloning this repository, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to set up your environment. This project runs on **Python 3.9.7**, and some of the main modules utilized in this demo are **tensorflow**, **keras**, **turtle**, and **gym**.
____
## I recommend setting up this project in a **virtual environment**.
#### If you are new to python programming, I'd reccommend the following steps:
1. Download and install VS Code.
2. Install Python 3.9.7.
3. Install Git bash.
4. Run `pip install venv`.
5. Run `python -m venv <myenvname>`.
6. Navigate to the main project folder (`<projdir>`) that contains `<myenvname>` via `cd <projdir>`.
7. On Windows, `./<myenvname>/Scripts/activate` to activate the virtual environment.
8. On Linux or Mac, `source <myenvname>/bin/activate` to do the same thing.
9. Once your virtual environment is activated, close and restart your VS Code terminal.
10. You should see a `(<myenvname>)` string above the terminal input when the environment is active.
11. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open VS Code's command palette.
12. From the dropdown menu, click `Python: Select Interpreter`
13. Select `Python 3.9.7 64-bit ('<myenvname>':venv)`. (It may already be selected automatically.)
14. Run `pip list` to see a list of installed packages. It should only have 2-3 modules.
15. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies on your activated virtual environment.
16. Once everything is installed, run `python environment.py` to test if you can play the game manually.
17. Next, run `python agent.py` to see if the agent is able to play the game.
18. Let the agent run to the end and check that **plotting.py** is able to produce a graph.
19. Have fun reading through and playing with the code.
20. If you are brand new to reinforcement learning, I would recommend reading through **environment.py** before **agent.py**.
____
## To do:
- Allow for several user-definable agents via **config.json** files.
- ~~Clean up **plotting.py** and add the ability to save figures locally.~~
- Add hyperparameter settings to the learning curve figure generated by **plotting.py**.
- Expand **README.md** to include a high-level overview of how the network is trained via a **Bellman equation**.
- **Allow for models to be saved.**
- **Allow previously trained models to play with saved settings.**
- **Allow previously trained models to play and resume training.**
- Expand **plotting.py** to store a hyperparameter configuration's collection of training episodes as a gif.
