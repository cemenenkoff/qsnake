# Snake and Deep Q Reinforcement Learning

This project contains the following files:
1. **environment.py**

   This is the environment that represents the snake game. If you run `python environment.py`, you'll be able to play snake manually with the arrow keys.
____
2. **agent.py**

   This script trains an agent to play snake via a deep Q-learning network. Running `python agent.py` causes the agent to autonomously train over a specified number of episodes.
____
3. **plotting.py**

   This is a supporting script that graphs some statistics about how the network was trained and the performance of the agent.
____
4. **requirements.txt**

   After cloning this repository, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to set up your environment. This project runs on **Python 3.9.7**, and some of the main modules utilized in this demo are **tensorflow**, **keras**, **turtle**, and **gym**.
____
## To do:
- Allow for several user-definable agents via **config.json** files.
- ~~Clean up **plotting.py** and add the ability to save figures locally.~~
- Add hyperparameter settings to the learning curve figure generated by **plotting.py**.
- Expand **README.md** to include a high-level overview of how the network is trained via a **Bellman equation**.
- **Allow for models to be saved.**
- **Allow previously trained models to play with saved settings.**
- **Allow previously trained models to play and resume training.**
- Expand **plotting.py** to store a hyperparameter configuration's collection of training episodes as a gif.
